/*13.Implement a shoot ability for the player racket. The ability should only be activated when a Gift object falls on the racket. 
 The shot objects should be a new class (e.g. Bullet) and should destroy normal Block objects 
 (and be destroyed on collision with any block). Use the engine and ShootPlayerRacket method you implemented in task 4, 
 but don't add items in any of the engine lists through the ShootPlayerRacket method. Also don't edit the Racket.cs file. 
 Hint: you should have a ShootingRacket class and override its ProduceObjects method.*/
